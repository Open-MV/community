# Project Naming Guidelines

The names of projects can have meaning and send messages, intentionally or not.
To avoid sending the wrong messages, this document includes a few *non-binding*
recommendations for project naming.

These guidelines apply primarily to early sandbox projects.
It is expected that as a project reaches maturity and adoption, the OMF will re-evaluate
its name before folding its maintenance into the organization.

## 1. Avoid tentpole names

Having a large amount of projects and standard proposals share the same or similar names,
can create the impression that the Open Metaverse Foundation is attempting to create a
'name brand' standard.
This gives the impression to other groups that it is forcing a specific vision through on
name and momentum alone, and locking other groups out of the conversation.
This is directly in conflict with our core goals and vision, which encourage working with
other groups.

Additionally, not all projects will adopted and continue to be maintained by the OMF.
Avoiding tentpole names allows these projects to be branched out and continued by other
groups, without creating additional confusion.

### Avoid names that directly associate with the Open Metaverse Foundation

The following names are examples of what you should **not** do:

- OMF Object
- OpenMV Viewer

Folding individual projects under the OMF tentpole by name creates unnecessary conflict.

### Avoid names that directly associate with other projects

The following names are examples of what you should **not** do:

- Linux Metaverse
- OpenXR Viewer

This appears like the OMF is trying to claim ownership over other groups.

### Avoid common names for multiple projects

The following names, while fine on their own, are examples of what you should **not** do
in aggregate:

- Menos Viewer
- Menos Object Format
- Standard Menos API

Example name "Menos" taken from the greek word "berdem√©nos" to mean "confusing".

While a project name "Menos Viewer" by itself would be fine, multiple separate projects
all following the same 'tentpole' name, again creates a 'name brand' association we
want to avoid.

## 2. Avoid name conflicts

Before picking a name for a project, make sure that your name doesn't conflict with other
active open source projects.
This will avoid creating unnecessary conflict.

## 3. Discuss project names with the community

Discussing names with the OMF community before using them will allow issues to be spotted
early that you may have missed.
For example, certain words have different (and sometimes offensive) meanings in other
languages.
